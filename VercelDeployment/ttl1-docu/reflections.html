              Our exhibit was both fun and made us feel nervous at first because we didn’t know how to accommodate so many students. At the beginning, only a few Grade 5 students came, around four of them, so everything was still manageable. But soon, more Grade 6 and Grade 5 students started arriving, and we suddenly felt overwhelmed by the large crowd. We started by introducing our exhibit and explaining our lesson, which was “Understanding Visual/Virtual Texts.” We showed them the website created, where they could scroll through the lesson and access videos and games. Their outputs could also be printed, so they would have a souvenir of their learning experience. One of the activities allowed them to draw anything they wanted on the website. After they finished, we printed their artwork as part of their output. They were very happy and excited to see their drawings printed. Before they left, we gathered them together for a short conclusion. We asked what they understood from the exhibit and explained that the printed materials they were holding were examples of understanding visual/virtual texts.
            </p>
            <p>
              Overall, it was a fun and meaningful experience. We learned how to handle a large group of students and how to make learning interactive and enjoyable at the same time.

              Coordinating the technical flow of the website during the exhibit taught me a lot about pacing and accessibility. I focused on making sure students could move easily from lesson to activity to output, and that the devices stayed responsive even with many users. Seeing learners engage with videos, games, and the drawing tool reinforced how multimodal materials can deepen understanding of visual/virtual texts.

              If I were to improve anything, I’d streamline the entry briefing and add clearer on-screen cues so large groups can self-orient faster. Overall, it was rewarding to watch students proudly take home their printed outputs and explain what they learned.

              At first, the growing crowd felt intimidating, but it quickly became an opportunity to practice clear instructions and crowd management. I helped guide students through the activities and encouraged them to explore at their own pace. The drawing activity stood out; students were more confident sharing ideas once they saw their art printed.
            </p>
            <p>
              I realized the value of concise explanations and hands-on tasks. Next time, I’d prepare more stations for high-traffic moments and add quick visual guides to reduce waiting and keep everyone engaged.
