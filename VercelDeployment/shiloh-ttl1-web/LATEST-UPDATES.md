# Latest Updates - Hero Section & Music Continuity

## Date: October 21, 2025

### Summary
Three major improvements implemented:
1. Changed hero section overlay from green to black for better text visibility
2. Removed rotating Anemo symbol animation
3. Fixed music player to continue playing across all pages

## 1. Hero Section Overlay - Black Dimming

### Changes Made
- **File**: `static/css/styles.css`
- **Change**: Updated `.hero-section::before` overlay
- **From**: Green gradient overlay `rgba(74, 157, 126, 0.7)` to `rgba(168, 216, 195, 0.7)`
- **To**: Black solid overlay `rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.6)` (60% opacity)

### CSS Code
```css
.hero-section::before {
    content: '';
    position: absolute;
    top: 0;
    left: 0;
    right: 0;
    bottom: 0;
    background: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.6);
    z-index: 1;
}
```

### Benefits
- âœ… Text is now clearly visible over the animated GIF background
- âœ… Maintains professional look with semi-transparent black overlay
- âœ… 60% opacity provides good balance between visibility and background visibility
- âœ… Works on all screen sizes and devices

### Customization Options
You can adjust the overlay darkness by changing the last value in `rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.6)`:
- **Lighter**: `0.4` or `0.5` (40-50% opacity)
- **Current**: `0.6` (60% opacity)
- **Darker**: `0.7` or `0.8` (70-80% opacity)

## 2. Removed Rotating Star Animation

### Changes Made
- **File**: `static/css/styles.css`
- **Element**: `.anemo-symbol`
- **Action**: Hidden with `display: none;`

### CSS Code
```css
.anemo-symbol {
    display: none;
}
```

### Result
- âœ… Rotating star/Anemo symbol is now hidden from hero section
- âœ… Cleaner, more minimalist design
- âœ… Text-focused hero section
- âœ… The SVG element still exists in HTML but is not displayed

### Note
If you want to bring it back later, simply remove the `display: none;` rule or change it to `display: block;`

## 3. Music Continuity Across Pages

### Problem
Music would stop when navigating between pages (e.g., Home â†’ Examples â†’ Activity).

### Solution
Implemented sessionStorage to persist music state across page navigation.

### Changes Made
- **File**: `static/js/music-player.js`
- **New Functions Added**:
  1. `restoreMusicState()` - Restores music state on page load
  2. `saveMusicState()` - Saves current state to sessionStorage
  3. `setupStatePersistence()` - Auto-saves state periodically

### How It Works

#### 1. State Persistence
```javascript
function saveMusicState() {
    const state = {
        currentTrack: currentTrack,
        currentTime: bgMusic ? bgMusic.currentTime : 0,
        isPlaying: isPlaying
    };
    sessionStorage.setItem('musicPlayerState', JSON.stringify(state));
}
```

#### 2. State Restoration
```javascript
function restoreMusicState() {
    const savedState = sessionStorage.getItem('musicPlayerState');
    if (savedState) {
        const state = JSON.parse(savedState);
        currentTrack = state.currentTrack || 0;
        const savedTime = state.currentTime || 0;
        const wasPlaying = state.isPlaying || false;
        
        // Load the saved track
        loadTrack(currentTrack);
        
        // Set the saved time
        if (bgMusic && savedTime > 0) {
            bgMusic.currentTime = savedTime;
        }
        
        // Resume playing if it was playing before
        if (wasPlaying) {
            setTimeout(() => {
                playMusic().catch(err => {
                    console.log('Auto-resume blocked, waiting for interaction');
                });
            }, 100);
        }
        
        return true;
    }
    return false;
}
```

#### 3. Auto-Save Events
State is saved:
- âœ… Every 2 seconds while music is playing
- âœ… When user clicks play/pause
- âœ… Before page unload (navigation)
- âœ… When tab visibility changes (switching tabs)

### Features
- âœ… **Music continues across pages** - Navigate freely without interruption
- âœ… **Remembers position** - Picks up where you left off in the track
- âœ… **Remembers track** - Stays on the same song across pages
- âœ… **Auto-play still works** - First-time visitors get 2-second auto-play
- âœ… **All tracks loop** - Playlist continues indefinitely
- âœ… **Modal control** - User can pause/play via audio modal anytime

### User Experience Flow

**First Visit:**
1. User lands on any page
2. After 2 seconds (and user interaction), music auto-plays
3. Music continues as user navigates

**Subsequent Page Navigation:**
1. User clicks a link to another page
2. State is saved (track, time, playing status)
3. New page loads
4. Music player restores state
5. Music resumes automatically from saved position

**Manual Control:**
1. User can pause music via audio modal
2. State is saved (paused state)
3. User navigates to another page
4. Music remains paused on new page
5. User can resume anytime via audio modal

### Browser Compatibility
- âœ… Chrome/Edge: Full support
- âœ… Firefox: Full support
- âœ… Safari: Full support (with user interaction)
- âœ… Mobile browsers: Full support

### SessionStorage vs LocalStorage
**Why sessionStorage?**
- Clears when browser tab is closed
- Fresh experience on new browser session
- Prevents music auto-playing days later unexpectedly
- Perfect for single-session continuity

2. **static/js/music-player.js**
   - Added `restoreMusicState()` function
   - Added `saveMusicState()` function
   - Added `setupStatePersistence()` function
   - Updated `initMusicPlayer()` to restore state first
   - Updated `playMusic()` to save state
   - Updated `pauseMusic()` to save state

---

## Troubleshooting

### Text still not visible?
- Increase overlay opacity in `rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.6)` to `0.7` or `0.8`

### Star animation still showing?
- Hard refresh browser (Ctrl+F5 or Cmd+Shift+R)
- Check if `.anemo-symbol { display: none; }` is in styles.css

### Music not continuing on page change?
- Check browser console for errors
- Ensure sessionStorage is enabled (not in private/incognito mode)
- Try clicking play manually first, then navigate
- Some browsers require user interaction before auto-resume

### Music auto-playing on every page?
- This is expected behavior on FIRST visit
- On subsequent page navigation, it should CONTINUE (not restart)
- If you want to disable auto-play entirely, remove the auto-play code in `initMusicPlayer()`

---

## Notes

- **SessionStorage**: State persists within the same browser tab session only
- **Auto-play**: Works on every first visit, then music continues on navigation
- **Track Loop**: All tracks loop indefinitely (Track 1 â†’ Track 2 â†’ Track 1...)
- **Overlay**: Can be customized to any color/opacity in styles.css
- **Performance**: State saves every 2 seconds, minimal performance impact

---

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

- Add fade-in/fade-out transitions when music resumes
- Add visual indicator when music state is being restored
- Add option to remember volume across sessions (localStorage)
- Add playlist shuffle option
- Add keyboard shortcuts for music control
